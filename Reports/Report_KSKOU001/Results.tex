\chapter{Results}
These are the results I found from my investigation.

Present your results in a suitable format using tables and graphs where necessary. Remember to refer
to them in text and caption them properly.


\section{Aim}
The objetive of this project is to design, implement and evaluate an algorithm, a model or a machine to predict the gait sequence of an animal (quadrupede or bipede) using Markov models.
Thus, for a given state S, the model should be able to predict the next state S + 1, with a certain degree of confidence.
